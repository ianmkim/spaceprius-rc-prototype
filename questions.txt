questions that need answering
 - long term path planning, what if the destination is beyond the current view?
 - iteration length, how many meters do we want to travel before we recalculate the mesh and path?
 - what kind of path smoothing algorithm?
 - do we want to include any ML based system to weigh the different triangles and optimize the cost function itself?
